# ⚠️ This Repository Has Moved

## New Location: [MeshForge](https://github.com/Nursedude/meshforge)

This repository (`Meshtasticd_interactive_UI`) is **deprecated** and will no longer receive updates.

## Please Use the New Repository

```bash
# Clone the new repo
git clone https://github.com/Nursedude/meshforge.git
cd meshforge

## Why the Change?

The project has evolved from a simple installer into a comprehensive **LoRa Mesh Network Development & Operations Suite**. The new name **MeshForge** better reflects its capabilities:

- **BUILD** - Install meshtasticd, configure hardware
- **TEST** - Frequency calculator, link planning
- **DEPLOY** - Service management, config activation
- **MONITOR** - Node tracking, system health

## What's New in MeshForge?

- Frequency Slot Calculator (djb2 hash algorithm)
- Security hardening (no more os.system, shell=True)
- Lightweight no-sudo monitor
- Professional documentation
- Better exception handling
